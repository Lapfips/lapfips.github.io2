            <h3>Laval : 2006 - 2009</h3>
            <p>
              He was born in Laval where he lived for the first three years of
              his life with his parents and his two older sisters. But in 2009,
              after the birth of his third sister, his parents decided to move
              to Faverolles and he had to change school.

            <h3>Faverolles : 2009 - 2012</h3>
            <p>
              Once he came to Faverolles he entered the school of the village
              from the first year of preschool (3 years old) to CM2 (9 years
              old). He skipped the CM1 class because the teacher was crazy and
              his mother asked the school to put him in a different class. But
              in 2013 his father found a job at Airbus in Blagnac, so they had
              to move to Blagnac.

            <p>
              For his middle-school years, he went to Cours Molière, near the
              tramway station of Serventy-Airbus. This was a very good middle
              school with small class sizes. On this middle school every
              students had their own computer to work. He had very good results
              for his three first years there. But, during the forth year, his
              grades dropped down a little bit, and it was hard for him, but
              fortunately during the Covid-19 pandemic their was distance
              learning with videoconferencies. During this time, the school was
              much easier because he didn't have to go to school.

            <p>
              He went to the high-school Sainte-Marie de Nevers, near the metro
              station of Jeanne-d'arc, just after his parents broke-up.
              Fortunatly he was at the same high-school as one of his friends
              and they were in the same class for their first year. He met new
              friends. He kept the same group until the end of high-school.
              During his second year he chose his specialities :
              Physics-Chimicals, Mathematics and Digital and Informatic
              Sciences. During this year he realized that he wanted to work in
              computer science. He was able to get his Baccalauréat with mention
              and with very good grades in his specialties.

            <p>
              During the last year of high-school, he received his letter of
              acceptance to the school he wanted to integrate: the IPI school.
              In september, he started his first year of college. Fortunately,
              the campus was near his house so he can go to the campus with his
              bike. He also met new people who have the same passion as him. He
              loves what he is doing in this school because he can work and
              learn more about informatic which always was his favorite
              discipline.
