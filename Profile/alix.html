            <h3>Aix-en-Provence : 2005 - 2008</h3>
            <p>
              He was born in Aix-en-Provence where he lived for the first three
              years of his life with his parents. He was close to his
              grandparents' house, so they were able to keep him when his
              parents were working. However, in 2008, his parents decided to
              move to Toulouse and he had to change school.

            <h3>Toulouse : 2008 - 2016</h3>
            <p>
              Once he came to Toulouse, he entered the school St-Aubin in the
              center of Toulouse close to Jean-Jaures from Petit-Nuage (2 years
              old) to CM2 (10 years old). From 2008 to 2010, he moved a lot
              because his parents wanted to find the perfect place for their
              family. They found it, they were happy but it was without the fact
              that his parents divorced in 2013 which marked the beginning of a
              succession of move either from his father's and mother's side. It
              was a hard time for him but he was still able to surpass it and
              have good results at school.

            <h3>Toulouse : 2016 - 2020</h3>
            <p>
              For his middle-school years, he went to Sainte-Marie de Nevers,
              near the metro station of Jeanne d'Arc. He had really good results
              for his two first years there, and everything went smoothly.
              However, during the third year, he had some issues with his
              comrades and his grades dropped down to rock bottom, it was hard
              for him to handle it. This situation continued for his last year
              in middle-school, but fortunately for him but unfortunately for
              the world, the Covid-19 pandemic allowed him to escape from
              school. During this time, he sent neither his works nor messages
              except for a drawing in his german class. He was still able to get
              his Brevet with the highest mention. He is really proud of that.

            <p>
              He went to the high-school Sainte-Marie de Nevers next to his
              former middle-school. When he first came to high-school, he wanted
              to have a decent start which he had. He met new people who became
              his close group. It was more or less the same group until the end
              of high-school. However, this group changed quite a lot because
              many different groups melt together. In this big new group, he met
              his wonderful girlfriend, they weren't close at first but started
              to talk during Summer vacation and ended up together. The final
              year of high-school was his happiest year since primary-school. He
              had good friends and a nice girlfriend. He was able to get his
              Baccalauréat with mention with really good grades in his
              specialties, Mathematics and Informatic.

            <p>
              During the last year of high-school, he received his letter of
              acceptance to the school he wanted to integrate: the IPI school.
              In september, he started his first year of college. Fortunately,
              his girlfriend wasn't far from him because she integrated an
              another school within the same campus. He also met new people who
              have the same passion as him. He loves what he is doing in this
              school because he can work and learn more about informatic which
              always was his favorite discipline.

              When he entered middle-school, he wanted to be an architect

              draw, create 3D-model and use many other tools to create things.

              In high-school, he wanted to work in cyber security because
              informatic was always something that he liked to do. This was
              enhanced during high-school when he discovered in more details
              what informatic was. What he loved the most about cyber security
              was the imagination he could have while imagining the link between
              servers and other technological devices.
