            <p>
              He was born in Shanghaï, but right after his birth, he was adopted
              by Mr. Jean-Marc Benito. He was raised and feed by him. After 3
              years he was able to integrate the school of his adopted father,
              the IPI school where he became a student.

              He was a true product of informatic, he was a genius above
              everyone else. Besides his young age and the fact that he was a
              panda, his grades were to the top, his comrades were jealous of
              his intelligence and the teachers despised him because he already
              knew everything they were teaching. He was able to graduate within
              a year.

              Mr. Jean-Marc Benito offers him to stay in the school and to
              become the mascot and leader of all students. Pixel accepted this
              offer and now resided in the IPI office, mostly known as the
              aquarium, helping students with their projects when they need him.

              After his meeting with Mr. Jean-Marc Benito, he wanted to become
              like him, the director of a huge university. However, he prefered
              science over informatic so he wanted to become the director of the
              Sorbonne in Paris.

              While studying at the IPI school, he wanted to become a great
              computer engineer, the freedom and creativity this work provided
              him was what he wanted the most. He wanted to go far away, work in

              He couldn't leave his school and adopted father. He really loved
              this school, the students, his father and wanted to work at the
              IPI. The job as a mascot Mr. Jean-Marc Benito offered to him was a
              revelation. He still works as such and loves his job.
